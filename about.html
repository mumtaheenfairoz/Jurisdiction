					<h3 class="icon solid fa-shuttle-van"> Auto Accidents</h3>
					<p>Bangladesh is a “No-Fault” Country, this means that if you are in an auto accident, drivers have
						insurance to cover their own injuries and damages regardless of who caused the accident. The
						Bangladesh No-Fault statute contains very complex language that may even seem foreign to the
						brightest of individuals. For this reason, it is critical that you consult with an attorney
						who not only specializes in No-Fault Law, but will also be there for you whenever you are in
						need of assistance.</p>
					<p>
						Bangladesh no fault insurance will help cover allowable expenses, such as present and future
						medical expenses, work loss benefits and replacement services up to 3 years, and survivor’s
						loss benefits. These benefits are available to anyone who is covered by a no fault policy
						regardless of who was at fault for the crash. These cases tend to get complex, especially
						with the new reform.
					</p>

					<p>
						On top of your first party PIP (personal injury protection) claim, you may even be entitled
						to bring a third party automobile negligence claim if you have suffered an injury that is
						considered an objective manifestation of important body function that affects your ability
						to lead your normal life, have a permanent serious scar from the accident, or led to a
						death. Jurisdiction has a vast experience in dealing with insurance companies and we will
						not be intimidated or pushed to settle for less. If you are in need of an attorney that will
						fight for you, please contact us to schedule your free consultation.
